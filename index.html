      <h3>eBay deliveries</h3>
      <p>eBay has become so popular that some people make a living just by buying and reselling on such a huge marketplace. We all know you can buy and sell nearly anything on the massive online auction site, but sometimes the dreaded “pick up only” can put you off buying your desired item and organising delivery yourself can make you think twice about selling your unwanted goods online.</p>

      <h3>Fragile item transport</h3>
      <p>If you’re buying breakables or selling a sculpture online, then chances are you might require a fragile goods transport company to provide safe passage for your purchase. Many items that you might need to transport could be classified as “fragile” and will require special care during delivery, moving musical instruments or artwork for example takes a lot more care than shipping a breeze block. For this reason, it is worth looking into a speciality fragile goods courier to move your items.</p>
